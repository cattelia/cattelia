With my combined skills of program management, automation, leadership, and stakeholder communications, I bring a unique perspective and passion for building clean, minimalist tools and applications that both companies and customers need. Let‚Äôs connect to explore how I can contribute to your team‚Äôs success!


In my spare time, I continue my studies and development as a programmer through little projects :] and play video games with friends.
